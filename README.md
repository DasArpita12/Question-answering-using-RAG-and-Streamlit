# Custom Question Answering System

Welcome to the repository for the Custom Question Answering System, a project I've developed to address the challenges associated with large language models (LLMs) and token limitations. This system leverages advanced techniques, including retrieval augmentation generation, and incorporates key technologies such as Langchain, Weaviate Vector Store, and Streamlit.

## Key Features

- **Custom Data Integration:** Tailored for specific datasets, ensuring optimal performance in various domains.
- **Retrieval Augmentation Generation:** Employing cutting-edge techniques to enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses.
- **Technology Stack:**
  - *Langchain:* Facilitating seamless integration for effective language processing.
  - *Weaviate Vector Store:* Providing a robust foundation for vectorized data representation.
  - *Streamlit:* Enabling interactive and user-friendly interfaces for data exploration.

## How it Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Custom data is processed to ensure compatibility with the question answering system.
2. **Retrieval Augmentation Generation:** Advanced techniques are applied to improve the system's ability to retrieve and generate relevant responses.
3. **Integration with Langchain and Weaviate:** Leveraging Langchain and Weaviate Vector Store for efficient language processing and vectorized data storage.
4. **User Interface with Streamlit:** Utilizing Streamlit for a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/question-answering-system.git
   cd question-answering-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the system:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main_app.py
   ```

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute enhancements, and provide feedback. Together, we can further refine and advance this Question Answering System to overcome token limitations and enhance natural language understanding. Thank you for your interest and collaboration!

**Note:** Ensure that you have Python and the required dependencies installed before running the system.
